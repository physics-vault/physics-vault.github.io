# Particle Physics
In this section I will go through the material in the following textbooks in order:

* Halzen and Marton's "Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics": [https://www.amazon.com/Quarks-Leptons-Introductory-Particle-Physics/dp/0471887412](https://www.amazon.com/Quarks-Leptons-Introductory-Particle-Physics/dp/0471887412)
* Griffiths' "Introduction to Elementary Particles": [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018)

Personally I think Halzen and Marton's classic text "Quarks and Leptons" should be a must-read for anyone interested not only in particle physics,
but in quantum field theory (QFT). 
This is because it can serve as an introduction to the basic concepts assumed to be givens in classic QFT textbooks such as Peskin and Schroeder's "An Introduction To Quantum Field Theory".
