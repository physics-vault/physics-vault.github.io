# About
The origins of this site explained.

## Background
This site strives to document a personal journey to revisit some modern physics concepts, 
particularly some quantum field theory concepts, 
that I have encountered while studying as a research student at graduate school previously.

I plan to focus on a set of well-known books in the field,
and to work my way through these,
coming up with solutions to the textbook problems wherever and whenever possible,
and to share these using the space here. 

## Book lists
A preliminary list of textbooks targeted are as follows:

### Particle Physics
* Halzen and Marton's "Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics": [https://www.amazon.com/Quarks-Leptons-Introductory-Particle-Physics/dp/0471887412](https://www.amazon.com/Quarks-Leptons-Introductory-Particle-Physics/dp/0471887412)
* Griffiths' "Introduction to Elementary Particles": [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018)

### Quantum Field Theory
