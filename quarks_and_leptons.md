# Quarks and Leptons
We aim to be acquainted with the fundamentals of the modern physics realm via Halzen and Marton's classic textbook (see [Textbook](#textbook) section below).
Even though many textbooks have been written on the subject and that this book is somewhat outdated (as it predates the discovery of the Higgs boson, for example),
I have found personally that this particular text is superior in that it is authoritative, 
very detailed in its treatment of various relevant topics,
as well as comprehensive in that it deals with matters not discussed in more modern textbooks.
It is for this reason that I will start with this before proceeding to Griffiths' newer textbook on elementary particle physics.
